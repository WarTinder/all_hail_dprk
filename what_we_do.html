        <h2 class="section_title">Nuclear Weapons</h2>
        <p class="standard_text_style">Since the 1980s, we have been comitted to developing the world's best nuclear program capable of yielding detonation forces unlike anything mandkind has ever seen. Our first glorious launch took place on October 9, 2006 and while we had been working on it before, that wonderful day heralded the arrival of a new golden age for our great nation. Since then, we have worked tirelessly, conducting 6 more nuclear tests.</p>

        <h2 class="subsection_title">Truck-Launched ICBMs & the WS51200</h2>
        <p class="standard_text_style">We also have a very large and not at all for show arsenal of nuclear missiles that we can launch from trucks to destroy any and all enemies. Those missiles are launched from several placed, but one of the most effective deployment methods is truck-launched missiles. Truck-launched missiles can be launched from anywhere, and our ICBM-carrying trucks can reach anywhere in the entire country.</p>
        <p class="standard_text_style">The vehicle we use to launch our intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) is the WS51200. This is a truck capable of carrying loads of up to 80 tons and has a range of 1,000 km on a single fuel load, meaning that it can reach nearly anywhere in the entire country on a single load of fuel while carrying a nuclear-tipped ICBM. The missile we equip these trucks with is the gargantuan Hwasong-17 nuclear-tipped ICBM, capable of hitting anywhere in the U.S.A., that we have shown real versions of at parades that are definitely not fake because they don't roll around on the trucks and fake ones would roll around on the trucks but these are real nukes so they totally don't.</p>
